# fustrate-rails
JS/CSS framework customized to my preferences, long ago based on Foundation 5. Needs an actual name.

## Installation

Add the following at the top of application.sass:

```
@import "fustrate/colors"
@import "settings"
@import "fustrate"
```

Add the following at the top of application.coffee:

```
#= require fustrate
```
